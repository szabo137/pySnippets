The sfTrident module
====================

Introduction
------------
'sfTrident' is a module to perform calculations of the trident process in strong field quantum electrodynamics.
The main goal is to compute the amplitude of the trident process as well as several intermediate quanities.

Getting Started
---------------
Here follows the getting started with some (general) examples.
